This course, and the associated resources, aims to introduce statistics and experimental design using R. The course was led by Ellie Sherrard Smith et al. and I chose this course because the focus is on entomological data and malaria programs.

The lessons and code shared are relevant to a wider range of analyses and take the learner through installation of key programs to producing publishable-standard 
figures and statistical analysis.

The course assumes no previous training in R and statistics. We will debate statistical philosophies!
