# Introduction to data analysis using R

This repo contains the associated resources, aims to introduce statistics and experimental design using R. 

I chose this course because the focus is on entomological data and malaria programs.

The lessons and code shared are relevant to a wider range of analyses and take the learner through installation of key programs to producing publishable-standard figures and statistical analysis.

The course assumes no previous training in R and statistics and it's was led by Ellie Sherrard Smith et al.
